NOTE: This license is provided to formalize Dr. Bryan Duggan's stated intent
that Tunepal Nua be "free and open-source" (see his blog announcement at
https://bryanduggan.org/2024/04/01/new-tunepal-using-godot/). The MIT License
was chosen as it aligns with the permissive licensing of the project's
dependencies (godot-cpp, godot-sqlite, godot-midi).

If Bryan specifies a different license for the upstream repository, this
file should be updated to match his choice.
